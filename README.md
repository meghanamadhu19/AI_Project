AI_PROJECT: Reinforcement Learning Technique to assist Cab Drivers

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions based on feedback from its environment. It has been used successfully in a variety of applications including robotics, game-playing, and recommendation systems.

In this project, cab drivers could benefit from RL-based route optimization. RL could be used to learn the best routes based on factors like traffic, weather, and time of day. The system could also help cab drivers make better decisions about when to pick up passengers, which routes to take, and when to take breaks.

One key challenge with implementing RL in a real-world setting is determining how to provide feedback to the agent. In this case, feedback might come in the form of rewards for taking efficient routes or penalties for taking longer routes. Designing a good reward system that incentivizes desirable behavior can be difficult, but is critical to the success of an RL system.

Another challenge is ensuring that the system is able to adapt to changing conditions over time. For example, traffic patterns may change seasonally or due to construction. The system will need to learn and adapt to these changes to continue providing useful recommendations to cab drivers.

To implement the above, we need two files- Env.py and DQN_Agent.ipynb.

Env.py:

Define the environment class: Create a class for your environment that includes functions for generating requests, computing travel times, determining the next state, and calculating rewards.
Initialize the environment: Define the initial state of the environment, including the starting location of the cab and any other relevant information.
Define the step function: Create a function that takes an action as input, updates the state of the environment, and returns the next state, reward, and whether the episode has terminated.
Implement any additional functionality: Depending on the specifics of your project, you may need to implement additional functionality in the environment class, such as handling multiple passengers or accounting for traffic congestion.
Overall, the DQN_Agent.ipynb file should focus on training and testing the DQN agent, while the env.py file should define the environment in which the agent operates. By separating these concerns, you can more easily modify and improve the agent and environment independently.


DQN_Agent.ipynb:

Import required packages: You will need to import the necessary packages for the DQN implementation, including Keras, numpy, and any other required libraries.
Define the DQN agent class: Create a class for your DQN agent that includes functions for initializing the neural network, selecting actions, updating the replay buffer, and training the network using experience replay.
Define hyperparameters: Set the hyperparameters for your DQN implementation, including the learning rate, discount factor, exploration rate, and batch size.
Train the DQN agent: Use your environment and DQN agent to train the network using experience replay. Track the Q-value convergence and rewards per episode over time to assess the performance of your agent.
Test the DQN agent: Evaluate the performance of your trained DQN agent on a set of test episodes. Compare the results to the training metrics to ensure that the agent has learned an effective policy.
